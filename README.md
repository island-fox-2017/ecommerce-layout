### Header
http://ecommerceuxdesign.com/collection/website-header/
1. Link to Customer Service

Help customers who are stuck to find answers irrespective of what page they are on by providing a link to help/customer service along with the contact number on the website header. If they can find the information easily, then they don’t need to contact you for assistance and that would save your time and your customer's time.

2. Wish List

A wishlist allows shoppers to save the products so that they can purchase it later. Provide a wishlist or save for later button on the website header, but make sure it is not too prominent that it distracts the other important elements. Show a link to the wishlist even if the user has not logged in and prompt to sign in or sign up when a product is added to wishlist as it is a good way to gather email addresses.

3. Link to the store finder

Many shoppers webroom before purchasing a product. If you have physical retail outlets, then help shoppers find ones that’s closest to them. Include a link to the store finder on the website header. You can even include stores in your search results when users search for cities or zip codes.

4. User account

Provide your customers with a private account where they can check all their previous orders and the status of their current order. Offer a link to the user account section if the user has logged in. If not, display registration and login links. If you offer any interesting incentive upon sign up, then mention that near the signup link.

5. Track order

Show off your order tracking link on the website header instead of hiding it behind help or customer service links so that the customers who use the guest checkout can easily access the order status page. Even shoppers who have a registered account might want to know the status of their order quickly without having to log in.

6. Feature your customer service phone number

The simple act of adding a phone number, preferably a toll free number on to the website header establishes trust and help customers feel comfortable shopping with you. Displaying the contact number on the website header will make it easy for shoppers to locate it irrespective of the page they are in. Do keep in mind that doing so will be of any good only if you have enough staff to respond to the incoming calls. Also, clearly specify if you answer the calls only during specific hours.

7. Easy access to shopping cart

The shopping cart button has to be designed properly as it is essential for the purchasing process. It has to give an overview of the ongoing buying process. Specify how many items are currently present in the cart and how much they cost. Link it to the cart page. Most eCommerce stores place the cart icon on the upper right hand side of the page. Ensure that the cart icon is not crowded out by other elements, make it easy to find. Design a visually appealing cart or use just a simple text link based on your audience.

8. The Search Box

Sitesearch is an important navigation function of an online store. So, make the search box clear and prominent on the site-wide header. If your product catalog is very large, then allow users to choose the category before they perform the search. Don’t place any other boxes in the header other than the search box as that would confuse the shoppers. Use a button that reads “search” instead of a small search icon especially on the home page.

9. Help customers remember your brand

A clear, distinct and remarkable logo that appeals to the target audience is the basis of brand identity of an eCommerce store. Whether the logo is placed on the upper left corner as in most eCommerce stores or in the center, it should be displayed prominently. Add a catchy and memorable tagline below the logo that helps in brand building. Direct the shoppers to the homepage when they click on the logo.

1. Empty shopping cart design

When the shopping cart is empty, remind your users to add products to cart instead of just saying that it is empty. Provide shopping instructions and a call to action that entices users to do so. You can also include product recommendations or your store’s unique selling points.

2. Mini shopping cart (Option if main feature done)

Having a mini shopping cart is definitely not an alternative to the full page cart as decision making will be tedious with just a mini cart. It will help shoppers keep track of how much they spend and what they buy. Provide a link in the mini cart to view the full page cart instead of taking the user directly to checkout.

Use mini cart to confirm that a product has been added to cart. You can also include product recommendations which would make it easier for your shoppers to find more products.

3. Full page cart

Users make their final purchase decisions when they are in the cart page. Shoppers add products to cart so that they can review or compare the items they have chosen, check whether the order total meets their budget or whether they qualify for free shipping etc. So, design your cart page in such a way that it assists your shoppers in their buying decision.

### Checkout

1. Things to take care when you opt for a single page checkout

>> Data validation - Don’t wait until the user submits the form, validate and notify the user in real-time. Real-time inline validation will help your customers complete the checkout quickly with less effort and fewer errors. Make sure the notification is prominent enough that the user doesn't skip it.

>> Organize the checkout form - breakdown the checkout page into sections and keep the related items in close proximity.

>> Avoid asking unnecessary information - Single page checkout is meant to be quick and easy. So, avoid asking unnecessary information.

>> Shipping and billing addresses will be the same for majority of the orders. Pre-fill the billing address details with shipping address instead of asking the user to do a redundant job.

>> Show the zip code field and hide city and state. When the user inputs the zip code, expand the form with pre-filled city and state fields. Ensure these fields are editable.

>> Order summary in the right side area along with the call to action - pin this widget so that it follows the user when he scrolls down the checkout page.

2. Single page checkout (Option if main feature page done)
One-page or express checkout: As the name implies, shipping information, delivery information, billing and payment details will all be in one page for easy access and to make the checkout process as quick as possible. Customers need not go back and forth between the steps.
